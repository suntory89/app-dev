## Synopsis
Momo Ayase is a high school girl who believes in ghosts but not aliens, while her fellow highschooler, Ken Takakura, whom Momo nicknames "Okarun", believes in aliens but not ghosts. In a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the occult and the extraterrestrialâ€”Momo visiting the former, and Okarun visiting the latter. Momo is abducted by a group of aliens who accidentally unblock her chakras, enabling latent psychic abilities. Meanwhile, Okarun is possessed by a spirit who takes over his body. By using Momo's abilities and Okarun's possessed form, they defeat the aliens together.
